## A Number Guessing Game in JavaScript

This project implements a simple command-line number guessing game built with JavaScript and Node.js.

### Game Description

The computer selects a random number within a specified range, and the player must guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses correctly, decides to quit, or reaches the maximum number of allowed attempts.

### Features

- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Guess tracking and feedback
- Optional hint system
- Limited number of attempts to increase challenge

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Readline module for handling user input

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run `node game.js` to start the game

### What I Learned

- Working with asynchronous user input in Node.js
- Implementing game logic and state management
- Handling edge cases and input validation
- Creating an interactive command-line experience

This project was completed as part of the App Academy Open curriculum.
